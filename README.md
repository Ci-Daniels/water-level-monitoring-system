# WATER LEVEL MONITORING SYSTEM
Technology has advanced to the point that it can assist people in their daily lives. Human beings may benefit from this development in a variety of ways. This system is one that monitors the level of water in storage tanks, may monitor progress in levels of river water as well as notify the necessary parties wirelessly on their phones. 

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to develop an automated system for monitoring the level of water in an underground tank with push notification features using the Telegram Bot API.

## SPECIFICATIONS
 ### ESP 8266 NODEMCU
   -2.4 GHz Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n, supporting WPA/WPA2).
   -General-purpose input/output (16 GPIO).
   -Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C) serial communication protocol.
   -Analog-to-digital conversion (10-bit ADC).
   -Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) serial communication protocol.
   -I²S (Inter-IC Sound) interfaces with DMA(Direct Memory Access) (sharing pins with GPIO).
   -UART (on dedicated pins, plus a transmit-only UART can be enabled on GPIO2).
   -Pulse-width modulation (PWM).
   -It employs a 32-bit RISC CPU (reduced instruction set computer) based on the Tensilica Xtensa L106 running at 80 MHz (or overclocked to 160 MHz).
   -It has a 64 KB boot ROM, 64 KB instruction RAM, and 96 KB data RAM. External flash memory can be accessed through SPI.
